    <h1>What?</h1>
    <p>aliv is a light, fast, powerful and intuitive one liner live-reloading Node.js server. Created to help you get stuff done.</p>
    <p>You can choose the way to work with aliv: <span class="inline-cmd">cli</span>, <span class="inline-cmd">.alivrc</span> or a local node module!</p>

  <div class="what-explanation">
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>Created to push the web forward.</p>

    <p>It should be easy to run a HTTPS server.</p>
    <p>It should be easy to proxy a request to any server.</p>
    <p>It should serve the content fast.</p>
    <p>This is what aliv aims to solve.</p>

    <p>aliv simplifies a lot of headache we have when developing complex web apps.
      Proxy request/responses, implementing HTTPS, refreshing all your browsers with each change,
      serving content gzipped, having the server not consuming the whole memory/cpu, etc - was never so easy!</p>

    <h1>How?</h1>
    <p>After installing it, go to the folder with the
      <span class="inline-cmd">index.html</span> and run
      <span class="inline-cmd">$ aliv</span> (if you installed it globally) or
      <span class="inline-cmd">$ npm run your-script-here</span> if you installed it locally.</p>

    <p>Either use the options inline, by calling <span class="inline-cmd">$ aliv --port 9876 --quiet</span></p>
    <p>Or create a file called <span class="inline-cmd">.alivrc</span> with the following content:</p>
    <pre>{
      "quiet": true,
      "port": "9876"
}</pre>
